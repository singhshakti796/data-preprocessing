    "Because data is often taken from multiple sources which are normally not too reliable and that too in different formats, more than half our time is consumed in dealing with data quality issues when working on a machine learning problem. It is simply unrealistic to expect that the data will be perfect. There may be problems due to human error, limitations of measuring devices, or flaws in the data collection process. Let’s go over a few of them and methods to deal with them :\n",
    "1. Missing values :\n",
    "It is very much usual to have missing values in your dataset. It may have happened during data collection, or maybe due to some data validation rule, but regardless missing values must be taken into consideration.\n",
    "Eliminate rows with missing data :\n",
    "Simple and sometimes effective strategy. Fails if many objects have missing values. If a feature has mostly missing values, then that feature itself can also be eliminated.\n",
    "Estimate missing values :\n",
    "If only a reasonable percentage of values are missing, then we can also run simple interpolation methods to fill in those values. However, most common method of dealing with missing values is by filling them in with the mean, median or mode value of the respective feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inconsistent values :\n",
    "We know that data can contain inconsistent values. Most probably we have already faced this issue at some point. For instance, the ‘Address’ field contains the ‘Phone number’. It may be due to human error or maybe the information was misread while being scanned from a handwritten form.\n",
    "It is therefore always advised to perform data assessment like knowing what the data type of the features should be and whether it is the same for all the data objects.\n",
    "3. Duplicate values :\n",
    "A dataset may include data objects which are duplicates of one another. It may happen when say the same person submits a form more than once. The term deduplication is often used to refer to the process of dealing with duplicates.\n",
    "In most cases, the duplicates are removed so as to not give that particular data object an advantage or bias, when running machine learning algorithms.\n"

Aggregating the transactions to single store-wide monthly or yearly transactions will help us reducing hundreds or potentially thousands of transactions that occur daily at a specific store, thereby reducing the number of data objects.\n",

    "***Sampling*** is a very common method for selecting a subset of the dataset that we are analyzing. In most cases, working with the complete dataset can turn out to be too expensive considering the memory and time constraints. Using a sampling algorithm can help us reduce the size of the dataset to a point where we can use a better, but more expensive, machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "The key principle here is that the sampling should be done in such a manner that the sample generated should have approximately the same properties as the original dataset, meaning that the sample is representative. This involves choosing the correct sample size and sampling strategy.\n",
    "Simple Random Sampling dictates that there is an equal probability of selecting any particular entity. It has two main variations as well :\n",
    "1. Sampling without Replacement : As each item is selected, it is removed from the set of all the objects that form the total dataset.\n",

This can cause problems when the sample needs to have a proper representation of all object types, for example, when we have an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "***An Imbalanced dataset is one where the number of instances of a class(es) are significantly higher than another class(es), thus leading to an imbalance and creating rarer class(es).***\n",
    "It is critical that the rarer classes be adequately represented in the sample. In these cases, there is another sampling technique which we can use, called Stratified Sampling, which begins with predefined groups of objects. There are different versions of Stratified Sampling too, with the simplest version suggesting equal number of objects be drawn from all the groups even though the groups are of different sizes."
